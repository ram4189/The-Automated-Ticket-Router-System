# The Automated Ticket Router System

We know that amongst all the companies, the routing of tickets raised by both
internal users and external customers across departments has been a major challenge for years. Over the years, due to rising number of complaints, this has only
added to the complexity of matter. This project takes consumer court complaints
as one of examples to analyze the gravity of such problem and provide the AI
based solution to expedite the routing of tickets across departments. We aim
to reduce human effort and errors involving in handling the routing of consumer
tickets, also minimizing the delay. The solution tries multiple machine learning
models ranging from linear models like logistic regression, linear SVC to complex
ensembling based techniques like Random Forest and LightGBM classifier based
on multiple error metrices like precision, recall and F1 score. We then consider
the best performing model and create a WebAPI based solution around it which
is built using Flask and deploy the same on AWS.
